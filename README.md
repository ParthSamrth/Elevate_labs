# Cyber Security Internship – Task 1

## Task Title
**Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface**

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a strong foundational understanding of cyber security concepts, focusing on the CIA Triad, common attacker types, attack surfaces, and the importance of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Concepts Covered
- Cyber Security fundamentals
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Types of cyber attackers
- Attack surface analysis
- OWASP Top 10 overview
- Data flow in applications and potential attack points

## CIA Triad Overview
- **Confidentiality:** Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access
- **Integrity:** Ensuring data accuracy and preventing unauthorized modification
- **Availability:** Ensuring systems and data are accessible when required

## Types of Attackers
- Script Kiddies  
- Insider Threats  
- Hacktivists  
- Nation-State Actors  

## Attack Surface
Attack surfaces include:
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- APIs
- Networks
- Cloud infrastructure

## Data Flow & Attack Points
Typical data flow:
```
User → Application → Server → Database
```
Potential attacks can occur at each stage, such as injection attacks, MITM attacks, and unauthorized database access.

## Importance of OWASP Top 10
OWASP Top 10 helps identify and prioritize the most critical web application security risks, enabling developers and security teams to mitigate common vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- Web Browser (Chrome / Firefox)
- OWASP Official Documentation

## Deliverables
- Documentation explaining CIA Triad, attacker types, and attack surfaces

## Outcome
A strong conceptual foundation in cyber security fundamentals and threat awareness.
